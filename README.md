VeeamNotify now supports sending Veeam Backup & Replication session summary notifications to **Mattermost**! Configure your `config.json` with a Mattermost Webhook URL to receive detailed backup job results and status updates in your Mattermost channel.

## Supported Notification Services

VeeamNotify supports the following platforms:
* Discord
* Slack
* Microsoft Teams
* Telegram
* **Mattermost** (newly added!)

## Mattermost Configuration

To enable Mattermost notifications, follow these steps:

1. Edit the configuration file located at `C:\VeeamScripts\VeeamNotify\config\conf.json`.
